Microblading is a technique used for enhancing the appearance of the eyebrows. Pigment is implanted into the skin in fine, short strokes resembling hair, using a hand-held tool with a blade formed of tiny needles. Microblading is meant to look the most natural.

Powder brows is a form of permanent makeup that help clients achieve more of a powder look instead of individual hair strokes. Powdered brows heal to look like a soft makeup and work great for clients with oily skin.

Blade and Shade brows are a combination of hairstrokes and powder. This is the most popular in the microblading world! These brows are best for someone with already full but “patchy” brows.

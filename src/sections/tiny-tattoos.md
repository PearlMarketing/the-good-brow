Tiny tattoo’s are done with a single needle or small needle configuration depending on the design that allows for very dainty, fine line tattoos.

* This type of tattooing is extremely delicate and creates less trauma to the skin. A touch up is recommended for best long term results.
* A tiny tattoo is going to look best between 2-4 inches with minimal line work like a heart, flower, handwriting, etc.
* Tiny tattoo’s start at $85 and increase depending on design and placement.
* Tiny Tattoo’s require a booking deposit prior to booking.
* To request a booking please fill out our Request Form below. \

    description: How to know if you are NOT a good candidate for a Cosmetic Brow Tattoo
  - title: I book all first time Microblading appointments for a minimum of 2
      hours. This includes measuring and mapping the brows, numbing, color
      selection, microblading procedure and going over your at home aftercare
      instructions.

  - title: >-
      Typically, for most clients, about 12-18 months after the 6-8 week touch
      up. Keep in mind, I cannot guarantee results, everyone heals
      differently.  

      At home care and being mindful of your new brows is extremely encouraged!\

      Tanning, exfoliants, smoking, excessive sweating, and salt water swimming are some factors to early fading in some people.

  - title: >-
      Surface healing takes about 10 days after your initial appointment.  

      I will give you a brow soap, brow ointment & take home aftercare sheet to go over any descriptions you may have before you come back for your touch up visit.

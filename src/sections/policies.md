### POLICIES FOR COSMETIC TATTOOING

There are many factors that affect the healing process Â (how you take care of your brow tattoo, how your skin
heals and retains pigment, skin type etc.). There is absolutely no
guarantee with healed results.

A non refundable $100 deposit is required to secure your appointment for your cosmetic tattoo appointment. Also, a credit card is required on file to book a tattoo appointment. As these appointments take considerable time, I require 48 hours of notice to reschedule an appointment. Cancellations with less than 48
hours notice will be charged half of the cost of the service. If you cancel with less than
24 hours notice the full deposit will be automatically forfeited.

I accept all major credit cards. I do not offer any
refunds.

Please contact me if you are not able to make your appointment or if
you are running late. I understand last minute circumstances happen
and I will do my best to accommodate you. Being more than 15 minutes
late may result in losing your deposit and your appointment will need to be rescheduled.

NO SHOW APPOINTMENTS: The deposit will be forfeited and the card on file will be charged the remainder of the appointment cost if the client
fails to show up to their appointment. I respect your time, please
respect mine.

Prices are subject to change at anytime. You must be 18 years or have
Parental written consent to get Microblading.

Microblading is considered an invasive procedure, as a result you will
not be able to donate blood for one year.

I do not do touch-ups on other artists work.

### POLICIES FOR WAXING

First time clients, please arrive 15 minutes before your scheduled
appointment to fill out paperwork.

In order to hold any appointment over 30 minutes you must provide a
valid credit or debit card to place on file. Dont worry, you will not
be charged upon booking. You can still pay with a different card or
cash upon checking out.

If you are unable to keep your appointment I ask that you give me
24-hours advance notice. If you cancel with less than 24-hour notice
you are subject to a 50% fee.

If you do not show up for your appointment (no show), you will be
charged 100% of the full service price of all appointments booked.

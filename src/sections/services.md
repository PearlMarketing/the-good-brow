      Powder brows is a form of permanent makeup that help clients achieve more
      of a powder look instead of individual hair strokes. Powdered brows heal
      to look like a soft makeup and work great for clients with mature or oily
      skin.


      6-8 week touch ups are recommended for best long term results.
    price: $600.00 (2 hour +)

      Text and e-mail consults available upon request.


      Consult includes going over any questions you may have, a pre-draw
      of desired brow look, choosing a custom color, and what to expect
      after your initial appontment.

      Not all clients are good candidates for Microblading. 

      If you have any medical issues that you feel might be a
      contraindication, then I require you get clearance from your
      doctor.

Hi! My name is Emily and I am the owner of The Good Brow, LLC located in Manchester, NH.  I'm also a mama to the most amazing little man! I know the struggle and hustle of every day life- and somehow, BROWS help! 

I have been a licensed esthetician since 2009 and a NH Licensed Tattoo artist since 2016. Since working in this field, I have always felt like there was something missing; like I wanted more. After thinking it through for a period of time, I decided to go out on my own and start a business based on my drive to make women feel their absolute best. Now realizing, this is what I had been searching for! 

Your brows should be the last thing you have to worry about! Let me help. Let me make your morning routine that much easier.  My goal is for you to ALWAYS feel and look your best. 

I can't wait to meet you!

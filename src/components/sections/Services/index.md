Hi! My name is Emily White and I am the owner of The Good Brow, LLC located in Downtown Concord, NH. Ive been a licensed esthetician since 2009. Ask any one of my friends and they will tell you, I have always been "all about the brows." So, in 2016 I attended Microblading training. Since then, the sky has been the limit. After a few more trainings and completing an apprenticeship for a State of NH Tattoo License, This was a dream come true for me! Work on brows and make women feel confident?? HELL YES!

Your brows should be the last thing you have to worry about! Let me help. Let me make your morning routine that much easier.  My goal is for you to ALWAYS feel and look your best.

Trust me when I say, I know the true hustle of everyday life and I am happy to be here to help make you all feel extra beautiful!

I can't wait to meet you!

XO

      Powder brows is a form of permanent makeup that help clients achieve more
      of a powder look instead of individual hair strokes. Powdered brows heal
      to look like a soft makeup and work great for clients with mature or oily
      skin.


      6-8 week touch ups are recommended for best long term results.

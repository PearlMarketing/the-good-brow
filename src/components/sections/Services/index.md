      Consult cost goes towards your microblading appointment if you
      decide to book! Email consults are also available upon request.

      Consult includes going over any questions you may have, a pre-draw
      of desired brow look, choosing a custom color, and what to expect
      after your initial appontment.

      Not all clients are good candidates for Microblading. 

      If you have any medical issues that you feel might be a
      contraindication, then I require you get clearance from your
      doctor.

      Think pomade and powder makeup-look. This is different from
      Microblading, where it doesn't create hair strokes, but more of a
      "filled in" effect. Can be achieved via a manual handheld tool or
      the use of a tattoo gun.

      This works best for oily skin types as well.

      6-8 week touch ups are recommended for best long term results.
